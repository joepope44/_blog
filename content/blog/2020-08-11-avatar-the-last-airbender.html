<p>Today we are looking at text data from the scripts for the TV show ‘Avatar: The Last Airbender’.</p>
<p>I decided to see if certain characters that dominate a show affect the ratings in a postive or negative way. I am only going to use word count, as that’s all I have, but it would be interesting to incorporate screen time as well.</p>
<p>Below I walk through counting words per each episode, counting words per each character per episode, and then capturing that percentage.</p>
<p>First we setup our enivronment.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidytuesdayR)
library(tidyverse)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## ── Attaching packages ────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.0 ──</code></pre>
<pre><code>## ✓ ggplot2 3.3.2     ✓ purrr   0.3.4
## ✓ tibble  3.0.1     ✓ dplyr   1.0.0
## ✓ tidyr   1.1.0     ✓ stringr 1.4.0
## ✓ readr   1.3.1     ✓ forcats 0.5.0</code></pre>
<pre><code>## ── Conflicts ───────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
## x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
## x dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
## Attaching package: &#39;kableExtra&#39;</code></pre>
<pre><code>## The following object is masked from &#39;package:dplyr&#39;:
## 
##     group_rows</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>knitr::opts_chunk$set(
    echo = FALSE,
    fig.height = 5,
    fig.width = 8,
    message = FALSE,
    warning = FALSE,
    dpi = 180
)</code></pre>
<p>Load the data</p>
<pre><code>## 
##  Downloading file 1 of 2: `avatar.csv`
##  Downloading file 2 of 2: `scene_description.csv`</code></pre>
<p>Next we create dataframes to capture the text data for all characters, the totals per episode, then join them.</p>
<p>Create list of top 6 characters by word count. We will only plot these characters as they have the most words compared to the other characters.</p>
<p>Below is a first crack. I create a scatter plot and then use an ellipse to get a rough idea of the distribution and centroid for each character. Each point is an episode. I ignore which book/season of the series is involved.</p>

<p>Now let’s make the plot pretty. Notice how we can use the group.colors named list to dictate who gets assigned which color. Neat!</p>

<p>I use a density 2D plot to help show how the points are distributed. I don’t think this came out quite as informative as I would have liked, but it is interesting to see that Zuko has several episodes where he is speaking the most out of all characters, and those all appear to have relatively high ratings.</p>
