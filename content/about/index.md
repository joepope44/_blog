Hi, I'm Joseph Pope, a data scientist/analyst/visualizer and business intelligence professional living in New York City. 

While I enjoy taking online classes to learn new skills and techniques, I have found that working on projects regularly really helps reinforce the lessons that I am learning. I have kept myself busy with open data #civictech type projecst in the past, Rstudio's #TidyTuesday weekly projects, and other ad hoc work with Tableau, R and python. 

## Projects 

My first tweet for TidyTuesday was back in January. It is interesting to watch the progress as my data anlaysis skills have improved alongside my visualization skills.
